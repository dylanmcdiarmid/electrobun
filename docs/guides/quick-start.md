# Quick Start

Welcome to Electrobun! This guide will help you create your first ultra-fast, tiny desktop application with TypeScript.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have:

* [Bun](https://bun.sh) installed on your system
* A text editor or IDE (Blackboard's own [co(lab)](/colab/) recommended)
* Basic knowledge of TypeScript/JavaScript

## Getting Started

Create a new Electrobun project with a single command:

```
bunx electrobun init
```

It'll ask you which template project you want to get started with.

This creates a new directory with the basic project structure:

```
my-app/
├── src/
│   ├── main.ts          # Main process entry point
│   └── renderer/
│       ├── index.html   # UI template
│       ├── style.css    # Styles
│       └── script.ts    # Frontend logic
├── package.json         # Project dependencies
└── electrobun.config.ts # Build configuration
```

## Running Your App

Navigate to your project directory and start development:

```
cd my-app
bun install
bun start
```

This will use the Electrobun cli:

* Create a quick start project on your machine
* Use the Electrobun cli to do a dev build of your app
* Open your app in dev mode

## Next Steps
